### My-CV

#### Objective 🥅🥅🥅
The objective of this project was to learn how to create a page in CSS and HTML using Grid. Learning Grid was really the objective here, as well as seeing how to create an online CV using these resources.

#### Requirements ✔️✔️✔️
The final product had to be: 
- Responsive at many different screen sizes.
- Have visual heirarchy for each stage

#### Layout 🚧🚧🚧
I chose a readable layout that could work on many different sized screens. I first drew my ideas on paper and quickly realized that not everything I wanted to try was possible sadly. So I continued simplifying my design until I had something I could create myself after some research on Grid. 

#### Content ✒️✒️✒️
I at first wanted to mimic my current CV but I wasn't sure how to translate that to HTML and CSS just yet. So I tried something simple and simplified the contents as well. I included the important things:
- My job titles
- About me
- My language skills
- My work experience
- Social media links
& a photo.

#### Extra 👷‍♀️👷‍♀️👷‍♀️
If I had more time I would really love to improve on the look of this CV. I was struggling on the last project still when I was assigned this project and I had to rush a bit for this one. I did obtain the objective of learning Grid, but I would like to make it look more professional.
